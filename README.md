# Movie Recommendation System Using ML
ABSTRACT

The overwhelming increase in Data in today's world demands more experts to handle this 
massive amount of data in all industries. It stands out that the companies need more Data 
Scientists and Data Engineers to design and code the algorithms. Having said that, we often 
confuse ourselves in the responsibilities shared between these two groups of experts. “Data 
Scientists” are the ones who primarily design algorithms that can serve as the foundation for 
different prediction models such as Neural Network, Linear and Logistic regression, etc. 
However, “Data Engineers” are the ones who code using the predefined prediction models and 
try to increase the accuracy in the results and sometimes need to create recommendation 
systems as per the requirement. This clearly shows that these two groups of experts i.e. Data 
Scientists and Data Engineers works in perfect harmony side-by-side to create impressive 
solutions to handle the ginormous amount of data produced each day.

This project provides a thorough walk-through of the steps required for developing a hybrid 
algorithm (which combines the concept of content-based and collaborative recommender 
systems) to create a successful movie recommender system (Using Natural Language 
Processing, a field in Machine Learning). This effort of making a hybrid algorithm will predict 
and recommend movies more accurately.
